CICT’s 2H 2023 distributable income up 2.1% year-on-year to 
S$362.5 million  
▪ Proactive portfolio management and prudent cost management led to a 1.7% 
increase in distribution per unit to 5.45 cents for 2H 2023 
▪ Portfolio property value up 1.2% year-on-year to S$24.5 billion, bolstered by 
the Singapore portfolio 
 
Singapore, 6 February 2024 – CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust Management 
Limited (CICTML), the manager of CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT or the 
Trust), today reported a distributable income of S$362.5 million for the six months ended 31 
December 2023 (2H 2023).  This marks a 2.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase compared to 
the S$355.1 million for 2H 2022.  The higher distributable income was underpinned by sound 
operational performance driven by proactive portfolio management and prudent cost 
management.  
 
CICT's 2H 2023 distribution per unit (DPU) was 5.45 cents, up 1.7% y-o-y.  This brings the 
total DPU for FY 2023 to 10.75 cents, up 1.6% y-o-y, translating to a total return of 6.3%1.  
Based on the closing price of S$2.06 per unit on 31 December 2023, CICT's distribution yield 
for FY 2023 was 5.2%.  With the record date on Thursday, 15 February 2024, CICT unitholders 
(Unitholders) can expect to receive their 2H 2023 DPU on Thursday, 28 March 2024.   
 
CICT is also pleased to announce a Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) applicable to its 2H 
2023 distribution.  The DRP provides Unitholders2 with the option to receive their 2H 2023 
distribution in units, or a combination of both units and cash in lieu of the cash amount of 
distribution.  More details are shared in the Notice of Record Date and Distribution Payment 
Date dated 6 February 2024. 
 
In FY 2023, gross revenue rose by 8.2% y-o-y to S$1,559.9 million and net property income 
grew by 7.0% y-o-y to S$1,115.9 million.  The better performance was largely attributed to 
higher contribution from Raffles City Singapore and the full-year contribution from acquisitions 
completed in 2022.  This was offset by higher finance costs from the full-year impact of 
borrowings taken to fund the acquisitions in 2022 and higher interest rates. 
 
CICT's aggregate portfolio property value increased by 1.2% y-o-y to S$24.5 billion, based on 
CICT's proportionate interests in its investment properties and joint ventures as at 31 
 
1  Total return is based on the capital gains (based on the difference in the closing unit price on the last trading 
day of 2022 and 2023) and the total distributions announced for FY 2023 over the closing unit price on the last 
trading day of 2022. 
2  Only Unitholders with Singapore registered addresses will be eligible to participate in the DRP.

December 2023.  The uplift in portfolio property value was primarily driven by an improved 
operating performance of the Singapore portfolio, which grew in value by 2.0% y-o-y to S$23.0 
billion.  This growth offset the decline in value of the overseas portfolio, which was impacted 
by the expansion in the capitalisation rate for the Australian properties and an increase in the 
terminal capitalisation rate for the Germany properties.  CICT's adjusted net asset value per 
unit, excluding distributable income, remained stable at S$2.07, from S$2.06 a year ago. 
 
Ms Teo Swee Lian, Chairman of CICTML, said: "In 2023, CICT adopted a conservative 
approach in response to challenging market conditions and a high-cost environment.  We 
focused on driving organic growth through proactive portfolio management, prudent cost 
management, and discipline in capital management.  This strategy has yielded positive results.  
Despite the external circumstances, CICT's financial performance in 2H 2023 remained stable, 
highlighting the resilience and effective management of the portfolio.  Amidst prevailing global 
uncertainties, we will maintain a stance of caution and vigilance.  At the same time, our 
commitment to driving sustainable growth and returns remains steadfast." 
 
Mr Tony Tan, CEO of CICTML, said: "CICT achieved improvements in operational 
performance across its retail, office and integrated development portfolios, as evidenced by 
the higher committed occupancies and positive rent reversions.  We have taken proactive 
measures to address headwinds in the Australia and Germany markets, by embarking on 
upgrading and asset enhancement initiatives that will drive stability and growth in our overseas 
portfolio.  Despite cost challenges, we have maintained resilience in our home ground.  The 
solid fundamentals of our Singapore portfolio have continued to serve as a strong anchor for 
CICT's growth, strengthening the overall value of our portfolio."  
 
"In 2024, our focus remains on optimising our portfolio for growth through proactive portfolio 
management, value creation, and prudent cost and capital management.  The limited new 
supply of retail and office spaces in Singapore over the medium term will contribute to the 
sustained demand for our properties.  On the value creation front, the transformation of CQ @ 
Clarke Quay into a vibrant day-and-night lifestyle destination is on the home stretch.  We are 
in the final stage of the asset enhancement works, and store fit-outs are progressing rapidly 
targeting to be in operations by 2Q 2024.  Three of our properties, namely, IMM Building in 
Singapore, Gallileo in Germany, and 101 Miller Street in Australia, are slated for upgrading 
and asset enhancement initiatives. Concurrently, we will explore opportunities that 
complement our portfolio as we remain predominantly Singapore-focused," added Mr Tan.

Proactive portfolio management  
CICT's portfolio has demonstrated resilience, delivering strong operating metrics despite 
economic headwinds and rising costs.  As at 31 December 2023, CICT's committed portfolio 
occupancy reached 97.3%, up 1.5 percentage points (ppts) from a year ago.  This 
improvement extended across all asset types, with committed occupancies for retail, office 
and integrated development portfolios rising by 0.2 ppts, 2.3 ppts and 1.4 ppts to 98.5%, 96.7% 
and 98.5%, respectively.   
 
On the leasing front, CICT successfully signed approximately 1.7 million sq ft of new leases 
and renewals in FY 2023.  This comprised about 0.7 million sq ft of retail space and 1.0 million 
sq ft of office space.  In CICT's Singapore portfolio, tenant retention rates for retail and office 
leases in FY 2023 were 82.8% and 86.5%, respectively.  Rent reversions for the retail and 
office leases based on average committed rents in FY 2023 remained positive at 8.5% and 
9.0%, respectively. 
 
In FY 2023, our efforts to cultivate an engaging and immersive environment for shoppers 
resulted in an 8.6% growth in shopper traffic y-o-y.  Tenant sales per sq ft saw an increase of 
1.8% y-o-y, buoyed by higher consumer spending.  Notably, the downtown malls experienced 
stronger growth, with shopper traffic and tenant sales per sq ft rising by 9.5% and 2.5% y-o-y, 
respectively, benefitting from an uptick in Singapore tourist arrivals and consumption.   
 
CICT's retail portfolio has attracted growing interest from Asian retailers across various trade 
categories.  In 4Q 2023, CICT's malls became home to several new-to-market brands.  Bugis 
Junction unveiled an exciting addition to Singapore's coffee scene with artisanal Indonesian 
coffee chain Fore Coffee, while Westgate tantalised taste buds with the debut of Bingz, 
offering a unique twist on crispy Chinese burgers.  Bedok Mall launched the first official store 
of fashion-forward footwear brand VIVAIA, infusing vibrant and fresh energy into Singapore's 
fashion scene.  
 
In 4Q 2023, our office portfolio attracted new tenants, primarily from sectors such as IT, Media 
and Telecommunications, Real Estate and Property Services and Financial Services.

Value creation for sustainable growth   
CICT will continue to optimise its portfolio with three upgrading and asset enhancement 
initiatives (AEI) in 2024.   
 
Slated for a S$48.0 million AEI, IMM Building will launch its four-phase enhancement in 1Q 
2024 to strengthen its position as a regional outlet destination.  Targeting a return on 
investment of about 8%, the AEI will focus on sharpening IMM Building’s tenant mix and further 
enhancing shoppers' experience.  There will be a strategic rightsizing of the supermarket's 
footprint and unit reconfigurations on the ground floor's 126,000 sq ft of net lettable area (NLA).  
The enhancements will extend to refreshing common areas and upgrading mall amenities, 
including toilets.  The AEI will also incorporate the installation of more energy-efficient 
equipment to align with our environmental sustainability objectives.  The mall will remain 
operational throughout the AEI and the final phase is anticipated to conclude in 3Q 2025.  
Notably, the initial two phases have already garnered close to 70% pre-commitment, including 
those under advanced negotiations, reflecting robust market interest. 
 
Commencing in February 2024, Gallileo in Frankfurt, Germany, will embark on a planned AEI 
in three phases to elevate the property's relevance, functionality and operational efficiency 
with a target to achieve a minimum green rating target of LEED Gold.  At an estimated cost of 
between €175 and €215 million3, the AEI will elevate the property to modern Grade A office 
specifications, with works to improve the mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems.  A 
downtime of at least 18 months is expected for the AEI.  
 
In North Sydney, Australia, 101 Miller Street will undergo an approximately A$9 million 
upgrade to transform its lobby into a best-in-class multifunctional communal space in 
supporting tenants' return to office.  With the introduction of concierge services and a café/bar 
managed by coworking and executive space operator Work Club, the space will evolve into a 
lively social hub for tenants and guests, fostering connections and enhancing the overall 
tenant experience.  Set for completion in 2Q 2024, the upgrade will also improve the 
connectivity to Greenwood Plaza and the broader precinct, improving the overall accessibility 
and user experience of the integrated development.  
 
Disciplined and prudent capital management 
In line with our commitment to prudent capital management, CICT continued to diversify its 
funding sources with flexibility and agility.  CICT's debt maturity is well spread over various 
tenures, with an average term to maturity of 3.9 years. 
 
In FY 2023, we increased our commitment to green financing by issuing green bonds and 
sustainability-linked loan facilities totalling S$2.2 billion.  The total outstanding sustainability-
linked/green loan facilities and green bond issuance was S$4.2 billion as at 31 December 
2023.  This accounted for 41.8% of CICT's total borrowings (including its proportionate share 
of JV borrowings) as at 31 December 2023. 
 
 
 
3  The projected AEI cost varies depending on whether it follows a single or multi-tenanted scheme and is subject 
to adjustments based on the final scope of the works.

As at 31 December 2023, CICT maintained an aggregate leverage of 39.9% with an average 
cost of debt of 3.4%.  Of CICT's total borrowings, approximately 78% were on fixed interest 
rate.  CICT's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's remained at "A-" and "A3", 
respectively.
